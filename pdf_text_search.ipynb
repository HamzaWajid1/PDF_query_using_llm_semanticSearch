Modern machine learning methods are described the same way, using the notations\\nand tools drawn directly from linear algebra. Even some classical methods used in the ﬁeld,\\nsuch as linear regression via linear least squares and singular-value decomposition, are linear\\nalgebra methods, and other methods, such as principal component analysis, were born from the\\nmarriage of linear algebra and statistics.
